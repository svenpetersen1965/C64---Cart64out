All signals of the C64 expansion port are connected to a box pin header. This way, they can be displayed 
with a logic analyzer or an oscilloscope. A helpful feature for analysing the functionality for a cartridge.
Some configuration and chip select signals are connected to a jumper, hence they can be interrupted by pulling 
a jumper, which might be useful for copying a cartridge. To provide a perfect timing for this, a micro controller 
could be connected to the Jumper JP1.

Also the signals from J2 can be connected to a bread board. The two GND and two +5V pins on JP1 are intended for this purpose.

# Rev. 0a
This revision is a derivative of Rev. 0. It offers two additional mounting holes, in case this board is used to be an extension of the port (not tested, yet).

# Calculation of the BOM
The compnent prices (PBC included) were summed up. The total costs are 2.99â‚¬ (depending on the part sourcing). No shipping fees are included.
